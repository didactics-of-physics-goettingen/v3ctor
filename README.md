A research-based simulation on vector fields, divergence, and curl.

## Run with Python
To run the simulation you need to have installed python version 3 and the package sympy. Install sympy and tkinter using the terminal command 'pip install sympy tk', after an installation of python from the https://www.python.org. To start the simulation with python, navigate into the v3ctor\_main folder (by using the terminal command 'cd file path') and start the simulation by using the command 'python v3ctor.py'.

## Run with Windows
If you don't want to install python, you can download the Git repository and extract the v3ctor.zip file in the Windows programs folder. Start the simulation with the v3ctor.exe file. The application may first be blocked by the operating system, then it must be released. Please note that the simulation demands a minimum screen resolution of [1400x800]px and small screens might need to be scaled.
